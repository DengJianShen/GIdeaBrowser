## Idea Browser Tool Window

<!-- Plugin description -->
All started from the need to have a Good Embedded Browser window inside the IDE, especially annoyed by jumping back and forth when doing some online tutorials
from YouTube.

Feel free to clone and open prs with various features so we can all enjoy missing Browser functionality.
